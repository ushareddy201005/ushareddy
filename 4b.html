<body>
<div class="container">
<p>This paragraph is a descendant of .container and is styled using the descendant selector.</p>
<div>
<p>This paragraph is a descendant of .container but not a direct child, so only the color is applied.</p>
</div>
<p>This paragraph is a direct child of .container and is styled using both the descendant and child selectors.</p>
</div>
<h2>This heading is an adjacent sibling example.</h2>
<p>This paragraph is an adjacent sibling to the h2 and is styled using the adjacent sibling selector.</p>
<p>This paragraph is also a sibling of the h2 but is not immediately adjacent, so only the general sibling selector applies.</p>
